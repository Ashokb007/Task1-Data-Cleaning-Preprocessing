# Task1-Data-Cleaning-Preprocessing
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing using Titanic Dataset

Steps to Run the Titanic Cleaning Code

1. Install Python (if not installed)

2. Install Required Librarie
   Open Command Prompt and run:

   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter

3. Download the Dataset
   Go to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv
   Right-click → “Save As…” → Save as "titanic.csv" in a folder of your choice.

4. Create a Notebook
   In the same folder, run:
   
   jupyter notebook
   
   This will open a browser window.

6. Run the code
   Click **Run** in Jupyter Notebook.
   You’ll see info, plots, and the cleaned dataset.

7. If you want to save the Cleaned Dataset, you need to add the last line in the code.

df_cleaned.to_csv("titanic_cleaned.csv", index=False)

This is the simplest workflow.......

* Install → Download CSV → Open Notebook → Paste Code → Run → Done ✅

Want me to also give you a **tiny text you can copy-paste** to send to your mentor describing what you did? (like a 2-3 line summary)
